# Analysing Layoffs using SQL

Tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown. The slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks and strong dollars overseas are hinting towards possible recession and tech firms have started laying employees off. This economic slowdown has made Meta recently fire 13% of its workforce, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees. This dataset was made with the hope to enable Kaggle community to look into analyzing recent tech turmoil and discover useful insights.

In this project, we will perform **data cleaning** followed by **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using SQL.

This project would be a blend of the above YouTube reference and the personal learnings that I've undertaken over the weeks using SQL.
